# Image_Processing
A repository for Image Processing class

#### Basic algorithms studded in classic image processing courses

>Interpolation have two functions bilinear interpolation and nearest neighbor. Compile like this:

```
python3 Interpolation.py 'image_name' 'interpolation_type (b|n)' 'factor_x' 'factor_y'

where:

 b = bilinear
 n = nearest_neighbor
 Factors are percentage of resize (0 = 0% 1=100%)
```

>Note that all algorithms are compilled like this way, you can see how to compile running each algorith that it will show you a message text how to compile
